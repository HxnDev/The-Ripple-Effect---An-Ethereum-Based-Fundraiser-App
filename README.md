## Description:

The Ripple Effect is a blockchain based de-centralized application that aims to bring transparency to the process of fundraising and managing donations for various types of charities. Our blockchain is built with Ethereum, using Ganache and Truffle to manage it. For the frontend (interface), we are using ReactJS. Fundraising and donations is a process that is typically not transparent or easily accountable. By introducing our blockchain into the process, we are making sure that anyone can view the donation and allocation transactions and track where money comes from and where it goes too. This makes the whole process transparent.
